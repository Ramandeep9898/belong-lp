            "description": "<p>Investing in stock markets and Mutual Funds in India is a popular choice among many NRIs looking to grow their wealth. However, figuring out the steps and procedures needed before and after moving abroad can be confusing.</p><p> </p><p>In this post, we’ll discuss the process, documents, and verifications for investing in India as an NRI. Read on!</p><h2>Who qualifies as a Non-Resident Individual (NRI)?</h2><p>A Non-Resident Individual (NRI) is an individual who is not a resident of India for tax purposes. To qualify as an NRI,&nbsp;<strong>you must satisfy both of the following conditions</strong>:</p><p> </p><p>1. You should be in India for a period not more than 182 days during the previous year,&nbsp;</p><p>and, </p><p>2. You should be in India for a period of not more than 60 days during the previous year, and not more than 365 days during the 4 years immediately preceding the previous year.</p><p> </p><p>If you visit India during the year, the period of 60 days as mentioned in (2) above shall be substituted with 182 days. Similar concession is provided if you leave India in any previous year as a crew member or for the purpose of employment outside India.</p><p> </p><p>As per the changes made in the Finance Act 2020:</p><p> </p><p>If your income, excluding income from foreign sources, is more than ₹15 lakh, the 60-day threshold mentioned above extends to 120 days.</p><p> </p><p>Additionally, if you are earning over ₹15 lakh, excluding income from foreign sources, and not liable to pay tax in any country, you are deemed a resident under new Section 6(1A).</p><div class=\"se-component se-image-container __se__float-center\" contenteditable=\"false\"><figure style=\"margin: auto;\"><img src=\"https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clx4a3rx6000caheo10zipfw1/images/3417b2c3-6a33-44c2-825e-c93926bd0118-1719566743711-compressed.png\" alt=\"\" data-rotate=\"\" data-proportion=\"true\" data-rotatex=\"\" data-rotatey=\"\" data-align=\"center\" data-size=\",\" data-percentage=\"auto,auto\" data-file-name=\"undefined\" data-file-size=\"undefined\" data-origin=\",\" style=\"\" origin-size=\"800,533\" data-index=\"0\"></figure></div><h2>How can NRIs continue investing in Stocks and Mutual Funds - A simple procedure</h2><p>Keeping your ongoing investments running in India while living abroad is straightforward. Let’s look at how to do this:</p><h3>1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://getbelong.com/blog/how-to-manage-your-indian-bank-accounts-after-you-move-to-uae-clxug9dy8003qhlzaiv0grl2l#nre-vs-nro-accounts\" alt=\"Get an NRE/NRO bank account\" class=\"on\">Get an NRE/NRO bank account</a>​</h3><p>Mutual Fund asset management companies (AMCs) in India do not accept investments made in foreign currency. Hence, you need to maintain either or both of the following:</p><ul><li><p>NRE (Non-Resident External) account</p></li><li><p>NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account</p></li></ul><p>Here’s how you can go about this:</p><p><strong>I. Convert your existing domestic savings account to NRO</strong></p><p>NRO accounts allow you to manage your income earned in India. It lets you manage your funds without the complexities associated with currency conversion and transfer regulations.</p><p> </p><p>If you have been investing in Mutual Funds and stocks while in India, you should convert all associated domestic savings accounts to NRO accounts (as required by RBI regulations). These NRO accounts will remain linked to your existing investments, and will further help you invest any income earned in India (e.g., through rental, interest etc).</p><p><strong>II. Setup an NRE account</strong></p><p>An NRE account would enable you to invest your UAE income in Indian stocks and Mutual Funds. This comes with the added advantage of being able to freely move your money back to UAE.

Update your KYC status from Resident Individual (RI) to Non-Resident Individual (NRI)</h3><p>This is crucial for compliance and to ensure your investment process runs smoothly. Here’s how you can get this done:</p><ul><li><p>Request your existing or new intermediary (e.g., your stock broker/platform, Mutual Fund distributor/AMC, bank etc) to update your KYC status. They can accomplish this by submitting an application with supporting documents to the centralised KYC database.</p></li><li><p>If you are in India, you can also go to the closest <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.kfintech.com/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\" alt=\"Karvy\">Karvy</a> or <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.camsrepository.com/CR_ServiceCentres.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" alt=\"CAMS\" class=\"on\">CAMS</a> office.</p></li></ul><p>Several service providers, including the KYC registration agencies (KRAs) like CAMS and Karvy, offer the facility to carry out this process electronically. However, if this option is unavailable or you prefer to handle these changes in person, you can visit your nearest CAMS/Karvy office in India. Here’s what you should carry:</p><ul><li><p>Passport copy (including visa pages)</p></li><li><p>Foreign visa and/or residence permit</p></li><li><p>Overseas address proof (e.g., utility bill, rental agreement, or bank statement)</p></li><li><p>Indian address proof (if required)</p></li><li><p>PAN card copy</p></li><li><p>Recent passport-sized photographs</p></li><li>Bank statement/cancelled cheque leaves as proof of holding NRO/NRE account</li></ul><p>Make sure to check the latest requirements with your intermediary at the outset of the process.</p><h3>3. Update your NRI Status in your existing Mutual Fund folios</h3><p>It's important to update your Non-Resident Indian (NRI) status for all your Mutual Fund accounts.</p><ul><li><p>You need to tag all your existing investments to your NRO accounts.</p></li><li><p>Besides, you must update your NRI status in all your fund folios.</p></li></ul><p>You can do so either though your investment intermediary or directly with each Mutual Fund house where you have invested.</p><p>To successfully update your folios, you will need to ensure your KYC is current, which includes providing updated bank account details such as IFSC code, account number, account type (NRO/NRE), and the name on the account.</p><p>Pro tip: It's vital that the name on all your documents (PAN card, Aadhaar Card, Passport, bank account/statement) exactly matches the name in your Mutual Fund KYC and folios. Even minor discrepancies can lead to the rejection of your update request. This attention to detail ensures smooth processing and avoids potential delays or complications.</p><h3>4. Tax Implications for NRIs Investing in India</h3><p>A Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) is a treaty between two countries that prevents individuals and companies from being taxed twice on the same income. Since India has a DTAA with UAE, this ensures you don’t pay tax on the same income twice.</p><p> </p><p>However, your mutual fund and stock investments will have certain tax implications. As per Indian Income Tax laws, here’s a quick look at the mutual funds' holding periods and taxation on capital gains for NRIs:</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"1\"><h3>Holding Periods for Mutual Funds</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div><p><strong>Fund Type</strong></p></div></td><td><div><p><strong>Short-term Holding</strong></p></div></td><td><div><p><strong>Long-term Holding</strong></p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><p>Equity oriented Mutual Funds (including Balanced Funds with equity exposure &gt;=65%)</p></div></td><td><div><p>Less than 12 months</p></div></td><td><div><p>12 months and more</p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><p>Debt-oriented Mutual Funds (including Balanced Funds with equity exposure &lt;65%)</p></div></td><td><div><p>Less than 36 months</p></div></td><td><div><p>36 months and more</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><br></h4><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"1\"><h3>Taxation on Capital Gains from Mutual Funds</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div><p><strong>Fund Type</strong></p></div></td><td><div><p><strong>Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) Tax</strong></p></div></td><td><div><p><strong>Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) Tax</strong></p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><p>Equity oriented Mutual Funds (including Balanced Funds with equity exposure &gt;=65%)</p></div></td><td><div><p>15%</p></div></td><td><div><p>10% without Indexation on gains in excess of Rs 1 lakh</p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><p>Debt-oriented Mutual Funds (including Balanced Funds with equity exposure &lt;65%)</p></div></td><td><div><p>As per tax slab</p></div></td><td><div><p>20% after Indexation</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">NRE Fixed Deposits: An Alternative Investment Option for NRIs</span><br></h2><p>As per Section 10(4) of the Income Tax Act 1961, NRE FDs are exempt from income tax in India.</p><p> </p><p>This means you can invest your money in India at competitive interest rates without worrying about taxes!

            "description": "<p>Moving to UAE is a big step for many to further their careers and professional prospects, but managing your finances while residing overseas as a non-resident Indian (NRI) can seem challenging. One common question that many people face is:</p><p> </p><p>What to do with my savings account?</p><p> </p><p>Well, you need to re-assign it as <strong>NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary)</strong>, and if required, open new NRO or <strong>NRE (Non-Resident External)</strong> accounts.&nbsp;Let's explore requisite tips, suggestions, and how-tos for enhancing the banking and financial services of NRIs in the UAE.</p><h2>Convert your resident savings account to a non-resident account</h2><p>Non-resident Indians (NRIs) need to either close all of their resident savings and other types of bank accounts or transform them into NRO accounts. This is a regulatory requirement.</p><p> </p><p>You must maintain an NRO account if you require it to carry out monetary transactions or have income in India. Here are a few quick steps to convert your resident savings account to NRO:</p><p> </p><ol><li>Visit the branch closest to you and provide your application along with the necessary paperwork. Many Indian banks have branches in the UAE, too. </li><li>Submit your request through the mobile banking app or online banking of your bank. </li><li>Complete a Re-KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure and submit appropriate proof (address proof, identity proof, photo) in addition to filling out the necessary forms.</li></ol><h2>Step-by-step process to open NR accounts in UAE</h2><div class=\"se-component se-image-container __se__float-center\" contenteditable=\"false\"><figure style=\"margin: auto;\"><img src=\"https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clx4a3rx6000caheo10zipfw1/images/93af2737-a3b2-4691-8e1f-c3e06a16e7cb-1719326287257-compressed.png\" alt=\"\" data-rotate=\"\" data-proportion=\"true\" data-rotatex=\"\" data-rotatey=\"\" data-align=\"center\" data-size=\",\" data-percentage=\"auto,auto\" data-file-name=\"undefined\" data-file-size=\"undefined\" data-origin=\",\" style=\"\" data-index=\"0\" origin-size=\"800,533\"></figure></div><h3>Step 1: Select the appropriate bank</h3><p><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">All big Indian banks provide NRI account services. Examine various banks, considering account kinds, minimum balance specifications, services provided, and ease of use.</span><br></p><p> </p><h3>Step 2: Ascertain the type of account</h3><p> </p><p>Two kinds of non-resident savings accounts are available to NRIs: NRE (Non-Resident External) and NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary). Though these are both Indian Rupee denominated accounts, they have significant differences in their tax treatment and ease of repatriation of money back to the UAE (or other foreign country of residence). Based on the following criteria, select the type of account that best suits your savings goals.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><div><strong>NRE Account (Non-Resident External)</strong></div></td><td><div><strong>NRO Account (Non-Resident Ordinary)</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Money can be repatriated freely back to UAE</div></td><td><div>The repatriation process involves a lot of documentation, tax repercussions, limits on the amount being repatriated, and may require RBI approval of the purpose of repatriation, as per foreign exchange regulations</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Transfer overseas earnings to invest in Rupees in Indian financial products (NRE Fixed Deposits, Mutual Funds, stocks)</div></td><td><div>Keep India-based earnings in India</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Money held in an NRE account is not taxable in India</div></td><td><div>Income received in an NRO account is taxable as per Indian tax laws</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>NRE accounts are susceptible to currency conversion loss (the value of the Indian Rupee may reduce over time relative to the value of the UAE Dirham)</div></td><td><div>No similar currency risks are associated with NRO accounts (income earned in India continues to be held in Indian Rupees)</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><h3>Step 3: Compile the necessary documents</h3><p> </p><p>Assemble the required paperwork, which usually consists of:</p><p> </p><ol><li>Valid passport bearing a visa to reside in the UAE </li><li>Evidence of non-resident Indian status (usually a valid residence permit or tax ID issued by the foreign country, including the Emirates ID for UAE) </li><li>Passport-sized pictures </li><li>Utility bills, rental agreements, and other documents attesting to your UAE address </li><li>Identity verification (such as additional government issued identity documents such as Indian PAN card, Indian Aadhaar card, Indian/UAE Driving License, Emirates ID)</li></ol><p> </p><h3>Step 4: Visit the bank</h3><p> </p><p>To begin the account opening procedure, visit the bank branch of your choice. You can even contact your bank in India before moving to the UAE or follow the requisite process during your return visit to India. The bank personnel will walk you through the necessary steps.</p><p> </p><h3>Step 5: Fill out the application</h3><p> </p><p>Complete the application for an NRI account that the bank has provided. Make sure that all of the details are up-to-date and precise.</p><p> </p><h3>Step 6: Send in your paperwork for KYC</h3><p> </p><p>Send in the completed application form along with the documents. The bank will carry out a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification procedure to meet regulatory standards.</p><p> </p><h3>Step 7: Activate your account</h3><p> </p><p>Upon confirmation, the bank will open your NRI account for transactions. Your debit card and account information will be sent to you along with additional pertinent data.

Objective</h3><p> </p><p>You need to open a non-resident external (NRE) account to convert your earnings to Indian Rupees while maintaining them outside India. This allows you to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://getbelong.com/blog/how-can-you-continue-investing-in-indian-stocks-and-mutual-funds-from-dubaiuae-clxyfnu5s001zesgufxqpxf70\" alt=\"invest your UAE income in various financial products in India such as NRE Fixed Deposits, Mutual Funds and stocks\">invest your UAE income in various financial products in India such as NRE Fixed Deposits, Mutual Funds and stocks</a>.</p><p> </p><p>An NRI can manage their income in Indian rupees while in the country by using an NRO account as a savings account. This may encompass dividend payments, rental earnings, and pensions. You can use this NRO account to manage existing investments in India, as well as further invest your Indian income.</p><p> </p><h3>2. Returnability to your foreign account (Repatriability)</h3><p> </p><p>Any money deposited into the NRE account, including any interest accrued, is non-taxable by the Indian Government.</p><p> </p><p>There are return limits on NRO accounts. After covering all relevant taxes, you can convert up to USD 1 million from an NRO account in a given financial year (April 1 - March 31).</p><p> </p><h3>3. Risk of exchange rates</h3><p> </p><p>Exchange rate risks, such as alterations and conversion gains/losses, can impact an NRE account. However, daily changes in exchange rates are less likely to impact an NRO account, but it is not continually risk-free because foreign income could also be passed on to it.</p><p> </p><h3>4. Tax guidelines</h3><p> </p><p>Income tax is not applied to any deposits made into an NRE account. This covers both the initial principal and the interest accrued. On the other hand, Tax Deductible at Source applies to interest earned on Non-Resident (NRO) accounts (TDS).</p><h2>Summing up</h2><p>The FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) laws of RBI restrict any individual residing outside India to use resident savings or current accounts. Hence, if you are moving to the UAE, you need to convert your savings account to an NRO account, and open additional NRO/NRE accounts as per your requirements.</p><p> </p><p>For a hassle-free and legally compliant conversion from a savings account to an NR account in the UAE, it is best to speak with your bank and get advice from a financial advisor.</p>"

            "description": "<p>The Indian expatriate community, NRIs, make up around 30% of the population of the United Arab Emirates, with a population of around 3.5 million as of 2021. This makes Indians the largest community in the UAE by ethnicity. As announced by India’s Minister of State for External Affairs, V Muraleedharan, in 2023, more than 130,000 Indians had moved to the UAE since the end of 2022. </p><p> </p><p>The movement of Indians on this scale requires NRIs to take up housing in Dubai. Most of those who initially reach Dubai cannot afford to buy a house there immediately and look to rent a property for residential purposes. Luckily the process to rent a property in Dubai is quite straightforward and without complications. A few basic documents are needed to complete this relatively simple process.</p><h2><span style=\"font-family: var(--ui-font); font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 700; background-color: inherit;\">What are the different types of rent agreements in Dubai?</span></h2><p>There are two types of rent agreements in Dubai. They are as follows:</p><p> </p><h3>1. Residential Rent Agreement:</h3><p> </p><p>Residential rent agreements are used in cases where the property being leased out is to be used for residential purposes, or in other words, the lessee will be living in the property. Such rental agreements are made for properties such as apartments, villas and townhouses, and these are to be used for the personal use of the lessee.</p><p> </p><h3>2. Commercial Rent Agreement: </h3><p> </p><p>Commercial rent agreements are used in cases where the property being leased out is to be used for business purposes. The lessee will be using the property to fulfil business needs. Such commercial properties may include retail shops, warehouses, office spaces and other properties for commercial use.</p><h2><span style=\"font-family: var(--ui-font); font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 700; background-color: inherit;\">What should you opt for when you first land in Dubai?</span></h2><p>In order to rent a property in Dubai, the Emirates ID card is a compulsory document. It takes some time to apply for and get your Emirates ID card. Hence, when you arrive in Dubai, you may opt to stay in a holiday home or take a property for a short-term rental. Such short-term rental is on the basis of your valid passport and may be available to rent for various short-term periods – daily, weekly or monthly, normally upto a maximum period of 6 months. Such short-term rental properties come furnished and have basic utilities such as electricity, water, and internet facilities. Short-term rental contracts are monitored by the Dubai Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) authorities.</p><h2><span style=\"font-family: var(--ui-font); font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 700; background-color: inherit;\">What documents do you need for a rent agreement?</span></h2><div class=\"se-component se-image-container __se__float-center\" contenteditable=\"false\"><figure style=\"margin: auto;\"><img src=\"https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clx4a3rx6000caheo10zipfw1/images/daa80b84-dfb5-4880-9861-5a4481d01ab9-1719300658084-compressed.png\" alt=\"\" data-rotate=\"\" data-proportion=\"true\" data-rotatex=\"\" data-rotatey=\"\" data-align=\"center\" data-size=\",\" data-percentage=\"auto,auto\" data-index=\"0\" data-file-name=\"undefined\" data-file-size=\"undefined\" data-origin=\",\" style=\"\"></figure></div><p><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">Before we go on to read about the documents and other registrations required to execute an agreement for a rental property in Dubai, let us learn about the laws governing tenancy agreements in Dubai. All rental contracts in Dubai and the subsequent relationship between landlords and tenants are governed and face regulation by the Dubai Rental Law No. 26 of 2007 and the subsequent amendment – Law No. 33 of 2008. Rental contracts in Dubai are regulated by the Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA) tenancy laws. RERA uses the Ejari system, which makes it mandatory for all tenancy agreements in Dubai to be executed in a government-approved format and registered there to ensure that all rental contracts are properly registered and monitored. You should also know about Decree No. 43 of 2013, dealing with all matters relating to increasing property rent, and Decree No. 26 of 2013, which deals with rental disputes and settlements through arbitration or courts of law.</span><br></p><p>The following are required by NRIs to execute a rental agreement in Dubai:</p><p> </p><h3>1. Passport: </h3><p> </p><p>A valid passport is the most basic of documents. It is required for identification purposes and as a support to the documentation to be executed.</p><p> </p><h3>2. UAE Residence Visa:</h3><p> </p><p>In order to go for long-term rentals, for periods ranging from 1 to 2 years, as an NRI, you need a valid UAE residence visa. You may also enter into a rental agreement with a tourist visa, but normally, the duration of such agreements is limited to 6 months.</p><p> </p><h3>3. Emirates ID Card:</h3><p> </p><p>This is a document that is required for most of the significant matters in your day-to-day life. Entering into a long-term rental agreement is no exception.</p><p> </p><h3>4. Ejari Registration:</h3><p> </p><p>As a tenant, you need to be registered on the Ejari platform of RERA in Dubai. You need to submit your lease agreement for approval on this platform, thereby ensuring that your lease is one which is legally binding and you are entitled to your rights and protection by this platform.</p><p> </p><h3>5. Standard Rental Contract:</h3><p> </p><p>The official website of the Dubai Land Department has the standard rental agreement contract, which can be downloaded. This contract form comes in both English and Arabic and is fully editable in order to customise it by adding or amending any conditions the landlord or the tenant wishes to have included. The contract may also be downloaded from the Real Estate Self Transaction app, popularly referred to as the REST app, launched by the Dubai Land Department.</p><p> </p><h3>6. Lease Agreement:</h3><p> </p><p>Once you have confirmed the property you wish to lease, you need to finalise the lease agreement. Do ensure that you go through all the terms and conditions mentioned in the agreement thoroughly. It is also advised that you do a minute inspection of the property you are about to rent and tally the realities with what is on paper.</p><p> </p><h3>7. Security Deposit:</h3><p> </p><p>Landlords in Dubai will ask for a security deposit, as is the practice all over the world. The security deposit is usually 5% of the annual rent in case the property you are renting is unfurnished and may go upto 10% of the annual rent in case the property is furnished.</p><p> </p><h3>8. Tenancy Contract:</h3><p> </p><p>Ensure that your landlord gives you a written tenancy contract. Such a contract needs to mention all the terms and conditions of the lease agreement and should necessarily include the rent and the schedule of payment of such rent. Your tenancy contract should also include the responsibilities of both parties to the agreement – the landlord and the tenant. </p><p> </p><h3>9. Post-dated Cheques:</h3><p> </p><p>It is often a practice in Dubai for landlords to take post-dated cheques from you, the tenant, on account of the rent payment in advance. In such cases ensure that you have sufficient cheque leaves with you.</p><h2><span style=\"font-family: var(--ui-font); font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 700; background-color: inherit;\">How can you search for houses to rent?</span></h2><div class=\"se-component se-image-container __se__float-center\" contenteditable=\"false\"><figure style=\"margin: auto;\"><img src=\"https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clx4a3rx6000caheo10zipfw1/images/b1c7690e-3729-48c7-96ab-53059c61101d-1719300688350-compressed.png\" alt=\"\" data-rotate=\"\" data-proportion=\"true\" data-rotatex=\"\" data-rotatey=\"\" data-align=\"center\" data-size=\",\" data-percentage=\"auto,auto\" data-index=\"1\" data-file-name=\"undefined\" data-file-size=\"undefined\" data-origin=\",\" style=\"\"></figure></div><p><span style=\"font-family: var(--ui-font); font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: 700; background-color: inherit;\">1.

There are certain obligations arising out of the contract and the local law that you need to be aware of. It is always a good idea to seek advice from a legal expert or a real estate expert to understand all this and to get updated information about the requirements currently applicable.</p>"

            "description": "<p>Indians who go to Dubai to work do not always go there with their families. Quite a number of expatriate Indian workers are unmarried and young. Dubai offers a good quality of life and a safe environment for Indians. However, the cultural differences and the local laws with strict censorship and restrictions on the internet, including an official ban on voice calls and video calls on the popular Meta-owned platform WhatsApp, may result in feelings of homesickness. Although the shops and supermarkets in Dubai sell nearly everything available in India, for those of you who have spent your formative years in India, a feeling of wistfulness is natural. NRIs in Dubai often long to be back in their homes with their friends and families, experiencing the life they have left behind in their hometowns in India.</p><p> </p><p>Dubai is a melting pot of all cultures and Indians being a predominant community there, have formed several associations of their own.

            "description": "<p>A will, also referred to as a person’s final testament, is an extremely important legal document that officially records the wishes of the person making it as to how and amongst whom the property and all other assets standing in the person’s name are to be distributed after the death of that person.</p><h2>Why is a will important for NRIs in UAE?</h2><p>Unlike India, the United Arab Emirates is a Muslim country governed by Sharia (Islamic) law. If an NRI dies without a will in the UAE, and he is a Muslim, then the courts in UAE will apply the Sharia law to distribute all his assets – movable as well as immovable - in the UAE. If, however, an NRI who is not a Muslim dies in the UAE without a will, then his legal heirs are given the option to opt out of the application of Sharia law to distribute his assets in the UAE. By opting out, his assets may be distributed as per the personal and inheritance laws of the religion of the deceased person or those of India.</p><div class=\"se-component se-image-container __se__float-center\" contenteditable=\"false\"><figure style=\"margin: auto;\"><img src=\"https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clx4a3rx6000caheo10zipfw1/images/a8daf04e-350d-49d1-a849-245a38c19857-1718971907001-compressed.png\" alt=\"\" data-rotate=\"\" data-proportion=\"true\" data-rotatex=\"\" data-rotatey=\"\" data-align=\"center\" data-size=\",\" data-percentage=\"auto,auto\" data-index=\"0\" data-file-name=\"undefined\" data-file-size=\"undefined\" data-origin=\",\" style=\"\"></figure></div><p><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">The laws of inheritance are applied in the UAE only when the deceased property holder has not created his will. As per Article 313 of the UAE Personal Status Law of 2005, inheritance refers to the act of distribution of the deceased person’s property among the rightful owners. As already mentioned, in case the deceased is a Muslim, the inheritance will be distributed as per Sharia laws. In case the deceased NRI is a non-Muslim, Articles 11 and 12 of Federal Decree-Law No. 41 of 2022 are applicable.</span><br></p><p></p><h3>1. Distribution of inheritance of a Muslim as per Sharia Law</h3><p>Sharia law is outlined in the Holy Quran and follows that system for the distribution of an inheritance. Legal heirs may include spouses, children, grandchildren, siblings and parents. The inheritance is to be distributed after the costs of the funeral and all the debts of the deceased person have been paid. Non-Muslims are legally not allowed to inherit the property of a deceased Muslim person.</p><p>Having a will in place allows the assets of the deceased person to be distributed only among those he wanted to enjoy the fruits of his hard work.</p><h3><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">2.&nbsp;</span>Distribution of inheritance of a non-Muslim opting out of Sharia Law</h3><p><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">In case a non-Muslim NRI dies without a will, the following steps are followed to distribute the inheritance. Please note that each step is applicable only if the conditions detailed in the previous step are not applicable in a particular situation:</span></p><ol><li>The property is to be divided in equal measures among the spouse and children of the deceased intestate person.</li><li>If there are no children, then the property is divided equally among the parents and spouse of the deceased person, with each getting 50 per cent of the property.</li><li>In case only one parent of the deceased NRI is alive, then the spouse will inherit 50% of the property and the remaining property, 50% in this case, will be further divided into two halves that are equal. One part, that is, 25% of the total inheritance, will be awarded to the living parent, and the other 25% of the total inheritance will be distributed among the brothers of the deceased person.</li><li>In such cases where the deceased person has no spouse, children or brothers, his parents will be awarded the entire property. Conversely, if no parent is alive and brothers exist, the entire property will be distributed among the brothers.</li></ol><p><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">These steps are applicable only when a non-Muslim person dies without leaving behind a will. In such cases, the children of the deceased non-Muslim NRI may also request for the distribution of the property as per Indian succession laws.</span></p><h3>3. Guardianship of children</h3><p>In case a person dies without leaving a will, UAE laws state that the courts will determine the guardianship of children below the age of 21 years. The mother of the children is not automatically considered to be the guardian of minor children as per UAE laws. Leaving behind a duly registered will ensures that the guardianship of your minor children is granted to your wife.</p><div class=\"se-component se-image-container __se__float-center\" contenteditable=\"false\"><figure style=\"margin: auto;\"><img src=\"https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clx4a3rx6000caheo10zipfw1/images/c3d7be0e-2090-4492-86a4-1786e02d15c4-1718971935591-compressed.png\" alt=\"\" data-rotate=\"\" data-proportion=\"true\" data-rotatex=\"\" data-rotatey=\"\" data-align=\"center\" data-size=\",\" data-percentage=\"auto,auto\" data-index=\"1\" data-file-name=\"undefined\" data-file-size=\"undefined\" data-origin=\",\" style=\"\"></figure></div><p><span style=\"font-family: var(--ui-font); font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: 700; background-color: inherit;\">4. Access to bank accounts</span><br></p><p><span style=\"text-align: -webkit-match-parent; background-color: inherit;\">All bank accounts of a deceased person, whether in single holding or held jointly with anyone else, are automatically frozen as soon as the news of the death of an individual is received by the banks as per Article 379 of the UAE Civil Code. Having a will allows your spouse to be able to access and control your bank account and the funds after your will has undergone the process of probate.</span></p><p>A point to be noted is that a will helps expedite the process of distribution of the assets of the deceased smoothly in the UAE as the law mandates the cancellation of the residence visas of the family upon the death of the husband. In such cases, the family is compulsorily required to leave the UAE within 30 days. Not leaving a will behind will make it very difficult for the legal heirs to complete all the issues relating to inheritance effectively and in a timely manner.</p><h2>What are the different types of wills based on what you own in UAE, and steps to make and register the will</h2><p><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">There are 2 types of wills that may be created by non-Muslims who reside in UAE and own assets there:</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>Notary Public Will:</strong> These are wills that are written in a bilingual format – in English as well as Arabic. Such wills need to be registered with a notary public in the same Emirate where the person preparing the will resides or has the assets. So a person who resides in Dubai and has assets in Dubai compulsorily needs to get the will registered with a notary public in Dubai.<strong style=\"text-align: -webkit-match-parent; background-color: inherit;\"><br></strong></p></li><li><p><strong style=\"text-align: -webkit-match-parent; background-color: inherit;\">DIFC Will:</strong><span style=\"text-align: -webkit-match-parent; background-color: inherit;\"> In the UAE, residents over 21, regardless of their religion, can register their wills with the DIFC Courts Wills Service (DIFC CWS). These wills follow common law principles and are prepared and registered as per the DIFC WPR Rules.</span><br></p></li></ol><p>You benefit by registering your will with DIFC WPR mainly for the following points:</p><ul><li><p>Unlike in a will registered with a notary public, you may distribute all your property – movable as well as immovable through a DIFC WPR registered will.</p></li><li><p>The DIFC WPR Rules address all possible situations you may come across with respect to drafting your will or its probate in the future. This is, thus, a more comprehensive system covering most eventualities and situations.</p></li><li><p>If your will is registered with the DIFC Courts Will Service, a probate order is issued much quicker.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">Apart from these types of wills, there are two other sub-types of wills as described below:</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>Single Will:</strong> A single will is a will for one person who is either not married, or even if married, whose spouse does not have any assets under his or her name. A single will is suitable for a married couple only in those cases where the couple does not have either a joint bank account or any property owned in a joint name. A single will is otherwise comprehensive as it deals with all situations such as the distribution of property, appointment of a guardian for minor children, appointment of an executor for the administration of one’s property and for dealing with gifts in wills.</p></li><li><p><strong><span style=\"background-color: inherit; text-align: -webkit-match-parent;\">Mirror Wills:</span></strong><span style=\"background-color: inherit; text-align: -webkit-match-parent;\"> Mirror wills cater to married couples with joint bank accounts and jointly owned properties. As the name suggests, mirror wills are for those couples where both spouses have the same or similar wishes in the distribution of their property. Mirror wills allow couples to appoint guardians for their children and leave the entire property they individually hold to any particular person as they wish.</span></p></li></ol><p><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">Wills in the UAE, if drafted only in English, need to be translated to Arabic also. NRIs have the option to get their will attested by the Indian Consulate upon providing proof of ownership of the assets mentioned in the will. Such submission at the Indian Consulate is to be done personally by the person whose will it is or by a person authorized by a specific Power of Attorney mentioning that the holder is representing the applicant for his or her will.</span></p><h2><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">How much is your will likely to cost?</span></h2><p>The cost you are likely to incur for preparing your will in the UAE depends on the type of will and the value of the assets being distributed. Following is only an estimation of the official fees and charges:<span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p>The official fee for registration of a single will by Dubai courts is AED 2,020.</p></li><li><p>In the case of a mirror will prepared by both husband and wife, the Dubai court fees will be doubled and the fees will be around AED 4,040.</p></li><li><p>DIFC Courts will charge an official fee in the range of AED 5,000 and AED 10,000 for single wills depending on the type of assets covered by the will.</p></li><li><p>In the case of a mirror will in the DIFC Courts, the charges are between AED 7,500 and AED 15,000, once again depending on the type of assets you wish to distribute through your will.</p></li><li><p>Abu Dhabi Civil Courts also allow you to register will since 2021. The fee charged for registration of your will at the ADJD Civil Wills Office is AED 950.<span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol><p>You may choose to register your will online yourself or to get it drafted by DIFC-approved Wills draftsmen or by a lawyer or law firm of your choice. Charges for such drafting vary accordingly.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: inherit; font-family: var(--ui-font); font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 700;\">What if you have a will in India and UAE?</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">NRIs may have a separate will to distribute their property and other assets in India. In such cases when they are making a will in UAE, they should specifically mention that this will is being prepared to cover the distribution of their property and assets in the UAE only.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: var(--ui-font); font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 700; background-color: inherit;\">Conclusion</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: inherit;\">NRIs leave their homeland and go to the UAE to work hard to create assets and buy properties with the fruits of this hard work. Their objective is to be able to live a better life and to provide their spouses, children and people back home with a better quality of life. The time after the death of any person is stressful for their entire families, and at such trying times, they should not be beset with worries about how to be able to access and enjoy the fruits of the labour of their deceased family member. Thus, all NRIs who reside in the UAE and Dubai must create and register their wills to avoid inconveniencing their families.</span></p>"

            "description": "<p>Are you planning to relocate to Dubai? Known for its innovation and luxury, this beautiful city offers a high quality of life and exciting career opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>From futuristic infrastructure to a vibrant culture, Dubai has something for everyone. Here’s a complete checklist to help you transition smoothly. With proper research and planning, your move to this modern metropolis can be cheap, swift, and stress-free! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>The Complete Checklist for Relocating to Dubai</h2><p>Before moving to Dubai, go through this checklist for Indians to ensure a hassle-free experience:</p><h3>1. Cost of Living</h3><p>When moving to Dubai, you'll find the cost of living attractive compared to other global cities. With minimal taxes, you can enjoy a higher disposable income. </p><p>Taxes in Dubai include a 5% municipality tax on rented accommodation and a 10% service charge on restaurant and hotel bills. They are usually included in the final price.&nbsp;</p><p>The average monthly costs without rent are around 14,020.2 AED for a family of four and 4,008.7 AED for a single person. The city's affordability has improved recently, making it possible to maintain a decent lifestyle on a budget of about 7,000 AED per month for an individual. This includes food bills, car expenses, rentals, and basic utilities.</p><h3>2. Accommodation</h3><p>Dubai’s housing options range from city-centre apartments to suburban villas. Rental terms are flexible, with payments often spread over multiple cheques.&nbsp;</p><p>Utility costs average around 750 AED monthly for a two-person apartment. Rent varies by location and size, with one-bedroom apartments in the city center averaging 7,000 AED and three-bedroom apartments about 12,950 AED.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you prefer a bustling urban environment like the Dubai Marina and the Dubailand or a quiet residential area like the Arabian Ranches and the Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai has diverse housing choices to suit various lifestyles and budgets. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3. </strong><strong>Spouse Working</strong></h3><p>In Dubai, spouses can work on a residence visa sponsored by their partner. However, they need a work permit from their employer. </p><p>Men can sponsor wives with a salary of AED 4,000 (or AED 3,000 with accommodation). Women can sponsor husbands if they earn at least AED 5,000 in qualified professions like teaching or medicine.&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Banking</h3><p>The UAE’s currency is the Dirham (AED). Setting up your finances in Dubai involves opening a local bank account. This requires an <a href=\"https://ayush.superblog.cloud/how-can-nris-make-an-emirates-id-card-in-uae-clxad1fnf0027udpomckub808\" alt=\"Emirates ID\">Emirates ID</a>, residency visa, and documents like your passport and proof of address. </p><p>Many international banks, such as HSBC and Emirates NBD, operate here. They offer straightforward online banking and international money transfer processes to ensure smooth financial management.&nbsp;</p><h3>5. Luggage</h3><p>Before you pack, check with your airline for baggage size and weight restrictions. Typically, Dubai airports allow two pieces of luggage with a combined weight of up to 32 kg. </p><p>For additional convenience, consider using cargo services like the Atlantic International Express or UBT Pro Express for personal belongings. In addition, familiarise yourself with specific airline policies to avoid any last-minute hassles at the airport.</p><h3>6. Transportation</h3><p>Dubai offers excellent public transport options, including the metro, buses, trams, and taxis. The <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.rta.ae/wps/portal/rta/ae/public-transport/Nol-Home\">Nol card</a> provides easy access to all these services. You can purchase these cards from any Ticket vending machines or Ticket Offices in metro and bus stations and RTA authorized sales agents.</p><p>The city’s infrastructure and connectivity ensure convenient travel, whether you stay in Dubai or commute from nearby Emirates like Sharjah. In fact, many people prefer living in Sharjah and commuting to Dubai due to lower rents.&nbsp;</p><p>Private cars are also popular, and buying and renting are affordable options. Besides, petrol prices are relatively low in Dubai.</p><h3>7. Education</h3><p>Education in Dubai is predominantly provided by private institutions following international curriculums. That's why tuition fees vary but are generally competitive with global standards. The Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) oversees school quality.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"se-component se-image-container __se__float-none\" contenteditable=\"false\"><figure style=\"margin: 0px;\"><img src=\"https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clx4a3rx6000caheo10zipfw1/images/2e07f433-b877-445e-84a7-ed8a243defd5-1718182257983-compressed.png\" alt=\"\" data-rotate=\"\" data-proportion=\"true\" data-rotatex=\"\" data-rotatey=\"\" data-size=\",\" data-align=\"none\" data-percentage=\"auto,auto\" data-file-name=\"undefined\" data-file-size=\"undefined\" data-origin=\",\" style=\"\" data-index=\"0\" origin-size=\"800,533\"></figure></div><p><br></p><p>You can choose from a vast range of options, from affordable to premium. Further, you can pick schools offering both Indian and international curricula. Some of the affordable schools offering ICSE and CBSE curricula include The Indian High School, The Little Flower English School, and St. Mary's Catholic School.&nbsp;</p><p>GEMS Modern Academy, Global Indian International School, and Delhi Private School are amongst the top Indian schools in Dubai.&nbsp;Therefore, research and choose schools depending on your child’s educational needs.</p><h3>8. Local Sim Card</h3><p>Upon arrival, get a local SIM card from Etisalat or Du. You’ll need your residency visa, an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ayush.superblog.cloud/how-can-nris-make-an-emirates-id-card-in-uae-clxad1fnf0027udpomckub808\" alt=\"Emirates ID\">Emirates ID</a>, and other identification documents. </p><p>You <a href=\"https://ayush.superblog.cloud/how-can-nris-make-an-emirates-id-card-in-uae-clxad1fnf0027udpomckub808\" alt=\"can apply for a new Emirates ID card\">can apply for a new Emirates ID card</a> either at an accredited typing centre or through the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Ports Security (ICP) website.</p><p>As a newcomer, you can initially opt for a tourist SIM card and then switch to a local plan once <a href=\"https://ayush.superblog.cloud/how-can-nris-make-an-emirates-id-card-in-uae-clxad1fnf0027udpomckub808\" alt=\"you acquire the Emirates ID\" class=\"on\">you acquire the Emirates ID</a>.

Shopping</h3><div class=\"se-component se-image-container __se__float-none\" contenteditable=\"false\"><figure style=\"margin: 0px;\"><img src=\"https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clx4a3rx6000caheo10zipfw1/images/e7105d4e-c8c8-42c0-887b-ef09577cc62a-1718182073309-compressed.png\" alt=\"\" data-rotate=\"\" data-proportion=\"true\" data-rotatex=\"\" data-rotatey=\"\" data-size=\",\" data-align=\"none\" data-percentage=\"auto,auto\" data-file-name=\"undefined\" data-file-size=\"undefined\" data-origin=\",\" style=\"\" data-index=\"1\" origin-size=\"800,533\"></figure></div><p><br></p><p>Dubai is a shopper’s paradise, featuring everything from luxury malls like the Dubai Mall to traditional souks offering spices, textiles, and gold.</p><p>The city offers a variety of Indian stores for all your shopping needs. From groceries at Al Adil and Lulu Hypermarket to jewelry at Tanishq and Kalyan Jewellers, you can find everything from spices and Ayurvedic products. </p><p>Additionally, the latest Indian fashion is also readily available. Popular stores like Fabindia and Malabar Gold &amp; Diamonds ensure you feel at home.</p><h3>10. Purchasing Parity</h3><p>The cost of living in the UAE is higher compared to India. However, the average after-tax salary in the UAE covers living expenses for <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://livingcost.org/cost/india/united-arab-emirates\">1.7 months, compared to 1.5 months in India</a>. </p><p>Despite the higher costs, the increased earning potential and quality of life make Dubai an attractive destination for expatriates looking for better opportunities. </p><h3>11. Dress Code</h3><p>Dubai’s dress code is generally cosmopolitan, but modesty is appreciated in public spaces. This means abstaining from wearing mini-skirts, tank tops, and other such revealing clothes. Furthermore, while Western attire is common, traditional clothing is also prevalent.&nbsp;</p><p>In places like malls and religious sites, it’s advisable to dress conservatively. Women should consider carrying a shawl for additional coverage when needed. Dubai’s fashion scene offers a mix of global and local styles. </p><h3>12.&nbsp; Entertainment</h3><p>If you love Indian entertainment, you'll need to deal with some geo-restrictions in Dubai. Licensing agreements and regional policies limit access to Indian channels. </p><p>The good news is that using a reliable VPN can help you enjoy your favourite shows on OTT platforms like Voot, JioCinema, and Star Sports. Despite the challenges, a VPN makes streaming Indian content possible.&nbsp;</p><p>For more insights, you can follow local influencers like Khalid Al Ameri, Joelle Mardinian, Taim Al Falasi, etc.</p><h3>13.&nbsp; Health Insurance</h3><p>Health insurance is mandatory for all residents in Dubai. Employers must provide insurance for their employees, and sponsors must cover their dependents. Most employers include family medical insurance in their packages, ensuring access to top-notch healthcare facilities. However, insurance costs vary based on coverage.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, public hospitals offer low-cost services, but you'll need a health card from the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.dha.gov.ae/en\">Department of Health and Medical Services</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>14. Driving License</h3><p>If you plan to get a car and drive in Dubai, you'll need to obtain a new driver's license, as an Indian Driving license is not transferable in the UAE. To do so,&nbsp;visit the RTA Driving License Centre, pay the necessary fee, and submit the required documents. Further, if you own an international driving license, don't forget to bring it.</p><p>You'll need to take driving lessons and pass a local test. Institutes like Emirates Driving Institute and Belhasa Driving Center can help. Make sure to complete this process promptly to avoid any inconvenience while settling in.&nbsp;</p><h3>15. Pet Relocation</h3><p>Dubai has strict regulations for pet relocation. Only two pets per person are allowed, and they must travel as manifest cargo in an IATA-specified kennel. </p><p>Ensure your pet meets the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.bayut.com/mybayut/pet-relocation-dubai/\">minimum age requirements and has up-to-date vaccinations</a>. Prepare all necessary documentation and consult with your vet to ensure a smooth transition for your furry friends. </p><h3>16. Fines</h3><p>Dubai has strict laws to maintain cleanliness and order. Littering, spitting, or making obscene gestures can result in fines or imprisonment. </p><p>Public intoxication and drunk driving are illegal, and narcotics are strictly prohibited. Always seek permission before photographing locals, especially women. </p><p>Public displays of affection should be minimal. Adhering to these rules will help you enjoy a safe and secure stay in Dubai. &nbsp;</p><h3>17. Language</h3><p>With a large expat population from the subcontinent, language barriers are minimal in Dubai. English is the primary language for communication, but you can easily converse in Hindi in many places. </p><p>This linguistic diversity makes it easier for you and your dependents to adjust to life in Dubai without facing significant language challenges.</p><h3><strong>18. </strong><strong>WhatsApp and Dubai</strong></h3><p>While you can send messages on WhatsApp in Dubai, voice and video calls are blocked due to privacy concerns. However, you can bypass this restriction by using a VPN to make calls. </p><p>Alternatively, local telecom providers Etisalat and DU offer Internet Calling Plans. You can use their plans for unlimited voice and video calls to stay connected with loved ones.</p><h3><strong>19. </strong><strong>Wi-Fi</strong></h3><p>Dubai's Wi-Fi UAE program provides free internet access across the city, but it's only available for UAE mobile numbers. Get a local SIM card from Du or Etisalat upon arrival to access this service. </p><p>For faster, unlimited internet, consider premium plans offered at malls, hotels, and public spaces, available for a small fee.</p><h3><strong>20. </strong><strong>House Help</strong></h3><p>Hiring a maid in Dubai is straightforward, with numerous agencies providing reliable, vetted candidates.&nbsp;You can opt for full-time (live-in) or part-time (live-out) help. The salary is negotiated during the interview stage and can vary based on the additional benefits and agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>Typically, full-time maids receive a monthly salary of AED 2,000-3,500. In contrast, part-time live-out maids usually earn between AED 3,500-6,000 per month, meaning you'll pay more for part-time help. However, part-time maids do not incur some of the additional expenses associated with full-time maids.</p><p>For full-time maids, you must sponsor them, including covering their visa, health card, and return flight costs. Part-time maids are typically on their company's visa and hired through agencies for hourly rates.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>21. </strong><strong>Used Cars</strong></h3><p>Looking to buy or sell a second-hand car in Dubai? Authorised dealers like Al Futtaim and Al Tayer offer reliable pre-owned cars with stringent checks.</p><p>You can also explore used car markets and newspapers for more options. While authorised dealers provide more guarantees, non-authorised dealers might offer better deals but come with higher risks.</p><h2><strong>Wrapping Up!</strong></h2><p>Relocating to Dubai can be overwhelming, considering the many aspects to manage, such as finances, visas, and housing. To ease this transition, consider hiring professional movers and packers who specialise in international relocations. This way, you can focus on settling into your new home while experts handle the logistics.</p>"
